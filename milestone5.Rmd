# The Data
These visualizations are based on data from Strava, a social network for sharing workouts.

This data was collected on October 18, and includes leaderboards for 8 popular climbs from around the world. Each leaderboard has thousands of entries from unique best times of those who have uploaded their rides to Strava.

The data was collected by me, using the Strava third party API.
